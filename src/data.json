I began teaching correct belay technique and have taught one of my friends who is now confident in belaying me without supervision"

In the meantime, I have dedicated myself to familiarising myself with various teaching techniques by shadowing climbing trainersâ€™ sessions and gaining more experience with para-climbing techniques."

I began climbing at age seven in the south of France and started competing in departmental and regional competitions from 2009 to 2013. While training for these competitions I was fortunate enough to experience both indoor walls and outdoor routes. In 2013, I moved to Exeter, UK, and joined a squad training for BMC competitions but was unable to continue due to the progression of my disability. I am currently trying entirely new methods of climbing but I am sure I will make a return to competitive climbing in the near future."

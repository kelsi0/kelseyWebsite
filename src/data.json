I began teaching correct belay technique and have taught one of my friends who is now confident in belaying me without supervision"

I began climbing at age seven in the south of France and started competing in departmental and regional competitions from 2009 to 2013. While training for these competitions I was fortunate enough to experience both indoor walls and outdoor routes. In 2013, I moved to Exeter, UK, and joined a squad training for BMC competitions but was unable to continue due to the progression of my disability. I am currently trying entirely new methods of climbing but I am sure I will make a return to competitive climbing in the near future."

I had began my musical journey with piano lessons as a child and then choosing to study music further at BTEC and finally degree level. Having started with classical piano, I originally found the transition into pop vocals difficult but after learning to play guitar and accompany myself I began to find my own voice. At the start of my degree, I continued to develop my voice and music theory when I fell ill and was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. This severly impacted my studies until my final year when I switched to the Musical Arts degree and focused on vocal and clarinet performance and composition. I found the strength in my voice and then how to develop and control it. After graduating, I began teaching piano to ages 6 to 80 as my customer base was growing the covid-19 pandemic hit and I was forced to stop. Currently, I am working on my own songs and my first EP in my free time while I focus on finding my feet and building a career in IT."

I am currently using various online resources to solve programming puzzles and further my experience."
